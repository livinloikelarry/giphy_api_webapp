# giphy_party

this project taught me how to:
use APIs to make HTTP requests and parse through responses using the Fetch API.
identify and implement asynchronous programming with async/await functions and commands.
create a branch using git commands and explain the purpose and importance of version control.
understand how pull requests track changes and implement best practices for code reviews on GitHub.
